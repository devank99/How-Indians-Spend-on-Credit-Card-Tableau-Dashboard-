Referral Programs: Encourage existing Silver Credit Card holders to refer friends and family by offering referral bonuses or additional points.
2. Address Gender Spending Gap
Tailored Offers for Women: Develop marketing campaigns and offers tailored to women, who are spending more on average. Consider partnerships with brands that are popular among women, such as fashion, beauty, and wellness.
3. Focus on Top Expenses
Utility Bill Payment Incentives: Provide incentives for using credit cards to pay utility bills, such as discounts, cashback, or bonus points. Partner with utility companies to streamline the payment process.
Entertainment Deals: Collaborate with entertainment providers (cinemas, streaming services, event organizers) to offer exclusive deals and discounts for credit card users.
